Technical Manual for the Baldwin Interlude 127f With Fun Machine  Machine 

I found it very difficult to find the Technical Manual for this electric organ.  The schematics of similar models, though more accessible, differ in some key ways.  The wiring diagrams, especially for the preamp and pedals, is unique.

Rather than allow others to have to guess as I did for some time, I'll just do what I can make the real manual more accessible.  Hopefully, I've added enough metadata to help this show up on a search.
